# DATA-STRUCTURE-AND-FILES-LABORATORY

( #Please_Note : Assignments are in order that is given below. )

1. Implement stack as an abstract data type using linked list and use this ADT for conversion of
infix expression to postfix, prefix and evaluation of postfix and prefix expression.

2. Implement priority queue as ADT using single linked list for servicing patients in an hospital
with priorities as i) Serious (top priority) ii) medium illness (medium priority) iii) General (Least
priority).

3. Create Binary tree and perform following operations:
a. Insert
b. Display
c. Depth of a tree
d. Display leaf-nodes
e. Create a copy of a tree

4. Construct and expression tree from postfix/prefix expression and perform recursive and nonrecursive
In-order, pre-order and post-order traversals.
5. Implement binary search tree and perform following operations:
a. Insert
b. Delete
c. Search
d. Mirror image
e. Display
f. Display level wise

6. Consider a friends’ network on face book social web site. Model it as a graph to represent each
node as a user and a link to represent the fried relationship between them. Store data such as
date of birth, number of comments for each user.
1. Find who is having maximum friends
2. Find who has post maximum and minimum comments
3. Find users having birthday in this month.
Hint: (Use adjacency list representation and perform DFS and BFS traversals)

7. Represent any real world graph using adjacency list /adjacency matrix find minimum spanning
tree using Kruskal’s algorithm.

8. Represent a given graph using adjacency matrix /adjacency list and find the shortest path using
Dijkstra's algorithm (single source all destination).

9. Store data of students with telephone no and name in the structure using hashing function for
telephone number and implement chaining with and without replacement.

10. A business house has several offices in different countries; they want to lease phone lines to
connect them with each other and the phone company charges different rent to connect
different pairs of cities. Business house want to connect all its offices with a minimum total
cost. Solve the problem by suggesting appropriate data structures

11. Department maintains a student information. The file contains roll number, name, division and
address. Write a program to create a sequential file to store and maintain student data. It
should allow the user to add, delete information of student. Display information of particular
employee. If record of student does not exist an appropriate message is displayed. If student
record is found it should display the student details.

12. Implement direct access file using hashing ( chaining without replacement) perform following
operations on it
a. Create Database
b. Display Database
c. Add a record
d. Search a record
e. Modify a record
